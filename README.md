### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
StagePatch is a project to help sound technicians in festivals and other live events to manage information about performers patch requirments in a way that automatically diseminates information to those that need it in near real time without being reliant on cloud/internet conections.
My youtube channel includes a video entiteled "why StagePatch" that explains the need for this and the issues faced. (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQUVoKUzDsku7qSlb5MVuNA)
